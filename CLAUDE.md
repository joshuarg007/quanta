# QUANTA Platform & Project DRIFT

> **FOR CLAUDE: Read the SESSION STATE, DESIGN PRINCIPLES, and DUAL-USE CONTEXT sections before doing anything.**

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES (Immutable Priority Order)

**Every decision in this codebase must respect this hierarchy:**

| Priority | Principle | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **1** | **Legal Protection** | Grants, tax status, IP, liability — non-negotiable |
| **2** | **Science** | DRIFT is the core mission; research integrity first |
| **3** | **Cost-Efficiency** | Prevent runaway costs; hard limits for external tenants |
| **4** | **Functionality** | Features that work correctly |
| **5** | **User-Friendliness** | Nice to have, never at expense of above |

### Cost Control Mandate

> **Preventing ridiculous costs must be hardwired into every aspect of this application.**

- External tenants (non-Axion) have **hard limits** on all resource-consuming operations
- Limits are enforced at the database, API, and UI layers (defense in depth)
- Exceeding limits = blocked (not just warned)
- Add-on purchases unlock higher limits (revenue driver)
- Axion Deep Labs tenant has elevated/unlimited access for DRIFT research

## SESSION STATE (Update before ending each session)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-11

### Where We Left Off:
- Defined multi-tenancy architecture based on SLMS pattern
- Clarified business model: DRIFT = internal R&D (grant-funded), QUANTA = pro bono education SaaS
- Established design principles with priority order
- Removed AI tutor from scope

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. Implement multi-tenancy models (Organization, updated User, etc.)
2. Create plans system with hard limits for external tenants
3. Build signup flow with domain-based org assignment
4. Implement usage tracking and limit enforcement

### Current Blockers:
- None documented

### Key Decisions Made:
- **Tenancy**: Both educational institutions AND Axion Deep Labs as tenants
- **Limits**: Hard caps for non-Axion tenants; pay-to-upgrade model
- **Revenue**: Add-on sales for limit increases; base education is pro bono (tax write-off)
- **No AI features**: AI tutor removed from scope

## DUAL-USE CONTEXT (Critical for Classification)

### The Two Planes

This platform operates on TWO distinct planes. **Never conflate them.**

| Aspect | QUANTA (Education Plane) | Project DRIFT (Research Plane) |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **What it is** | Educational SaaS platform | Scientific research program |
| **NAICS** | 541511 (Software Services) | 541715 (R&D Physical Sciences) |
| **Purpose** | Deliver curriculum | Generate knowledge |
| **Users** | Students, educators | Researchers, investigators |
| **Outputs** | Learning, competency | Data, findings, publications |
| **Status** | Commercial product | Active research |
| **Language** | "Learn," "practice," "master" | "Investigate," "observe," "characterize" |

### Classification Rule

> Activity classification depends on **intent**, **technical uncertainty**, and **outcome** — not on shared code or infrastructure.

### Governance Documentation

Full governance framework at:
```
~/Corporate/AxionDeepLabs/Quanta_Dual_Use_Governance/
```

Key documents to reference:
- `02_Policies/03_Dual_Use_Platform_Policy_Quanta.md` — Classification logic
- `02_Policies/06_Language_And_Labeling_Guide.md` — Approved terminology
- `03_Research_Charter/01_Research_Charter_Summary.md` — DRIFT focus

## PROJECT DRIFT (Research Plane)

### Full Name
**DRIFT**: Degradation Regimes In Iterated Field Transformations

### Research Focus
Investigating behavioral uncertainty in quantum system state evolution under repeated manipulation, focusing on gradual degradation of stability under variation in operator ordering and diversity, in regimes where closed-form analytical prediction is not feasible across all configurations.

### Scientific Basis
Supported by peer-reviewed literature:
- Tranter et al. (2019) — Ordering affects Trotter error
- Nakamura & Ankerhold (2024) — Non-Markovian sequence effects
- Huang et al. (2024) — Diversity as experimental variable

### Research Themes
1. State distribution dynamics under iteration
2. Operator ordering effects
3. Operator diversity effects
4. Predictability boundaries
5. Stability/instability characterization

### When Writing About DRIFT
Use language like:
- "Investigating behavioral uncertainty..."
- "Characterizing gradual degradation..."
- "Studying how state distributions evolve..."
- "Conducting hypothesis-driven experimentation..."

**Never** describe DRIFT as a product, service, or commercial offering.

## QUANTA EDUCATION (Education Plane)

### What It Is
An educational SaaS platform delivering structured curriculum and interactive simulation of established quantum computing concepts.

### Target Users
- Undergraduate/graduate students
- University educators
- Self-directed learners
- Institutions building QC programs

### When Writing About QUANTA Education
Use language like:
- "Learn foundational quantum computing principles"
- "Practice with interactive simulations"
- "Structured curriculum for universities"
- "Accessible learning experiences"

**Never** claim students are "participating in research" or describe educational features as "experimental" (unless actually part of documented experiments).

## ROUTE STRUCTURE (axiondeep.com)

### Implemented/Planned Routes

```
/                       → Home (Axion Deep Labs)
/solutions              → All offerings overview
/quanta                 → QUANTA Education Platform (commercial)
/quanta/pricing         → Subscription tiers
/quanta/demo            → Interactive demo
/research               → Project DRIFT (R&D)
/research/publications  → Papers, findings
/research/methodology   → How we conduct research
```

### Separation Principle
- `/quanta/*` routes = Education Plane language only
- `/research/*` routes = Research Plane language only
- Cross-linking allowed but with correct framing:
  - QUANTA page can say "Built on insights from our research"
  - Research page can say "Using QUANTA as our research instrument"
